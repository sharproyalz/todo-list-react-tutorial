## Lesson 3 - Literal notation

It refers to a way of representing values in code using their literal or direct notation. In programming, literal notations are used to define values directly within the code, as opposed to creating them through a constructor or a function.

Here are some common examples in JavaScript:

For String Literal.

```js
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
```

For Number Literal.

```js
const number = 42;
```

For Boolean Literal.

```js
const isTrue = true;
```

For Array Literal.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

For Object Literal.

```js
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "Exampleville",
};
```

For RegExp Literal.

```js
const regex = /\w+/;
```

For Function Literal (ES5 and earlier).

```js
const add = function (x, y) {
  return x + y;
};
```

For Template Literal (ES6 and later).

```js
const name = "Alice";
const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
```
